# IPL-analysis-Virat-vs-Rahul-
Some unknown facts which I got during the analysis:
- We know that Chris Gayle and Brendon McCullum are among most destructive batsmen in IPL, but the unknown fact is Chris Gayle and McCullum are the top 2 batsmen with highest dot ball percentage (min balls faced 2000) with 46 and 45% respectively.
- Even though Chris Gayle is at the top of the table in terms of dot ball percentage, he is the batsman with 2nd highest strike rate(min balls faced 2000)
- Shikhar Dhawan and David Warner are the batsmen who have taken most 3s in the IPL career, both with 23 3s, then comes Virat Kohli with 19 3s.
- Most 4s are hit in the 4th over of IPL till now with a tally of 1911 and most 6s are hit in the 20th over with a tally of 866.
- David Warner has scored the most runs in the 1st over(424) and MS Dhoni has scored most runs in the 20th over of IPL (655).
- Bhuvaneshwar Kumar has conceded most runs in 1st over while DJ Bravo has conceded most runs in the 20th over.
- Dinesh Karthik was involved in 37 run outsÂ , in which he was out only 13 times, his partner got dismissed in other 24 occasions.
